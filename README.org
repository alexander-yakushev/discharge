* Discharge

  Discharge is a not-again-why-the-hell-you-need-another-one static website/blog
  generator. It started as a fork of [[https://github.com/nakkaya/static][Static]], but eventually the list of changes
  grew too large to call it a fork.

  Here's the list of reasons why you would you suddenly want to use Discharge:

  - heavily relies on .org files for posts and site pages. Nevertheless other
    formats (Markdown, HTML and Clojure Hiccup) are supported;
  - supports page cuts (readmore's) for .org files;
  - uses Hiccup for page templates;
  - allows to embed Hiccup forms into org-mode files;
  - maintains file cache and in watch mode rapidly rebuilds only the pages that
    were changed.

** Dependencies

   Things you need to have installed:
   - [[http://leiningen.org/][Leiningen]] (to build Discharge jar)
   - [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] (to generate HTML pages form .org files)
   - [[http://pygments.org/][Pygments]] (for highlighting code blocks)

** Installation

   Build Discharge using =lein uberjar=. You'll get =discharge-app.jar= which
   you can use.

** Usage

   Build the site:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
java -jar /path/to/discharge-app.jar --build
#+END_SRC

   Watch mode: run Jetty server to browse the site locally and automatically
   rebuild it on changes:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
java -jar /path/to/discharge-app.jar --watch
#+END_SRC

   To view all supported options:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
